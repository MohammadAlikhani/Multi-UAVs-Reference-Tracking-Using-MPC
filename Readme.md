# Multi-UAVs Reference Tracking Using MPC

> Final project for the *Model Predictive Control* course at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).

This project implements **Linear** and **Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LMPC & NLMPC)** strategies for tracking reference trajectories with a fleet of three quadrotor UAVs, considering collision avoidance, input/state constraints, and wind disturbances.

## Overview

The objective is to compare LMPC and NLMPC approaches for trajectory tracking in a 3-UAV system under constraints, disturbances, and nonlinear dynamics. 

The controllers are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and behavior under wind disturbances.

---

## System Model

The UAV is simplified to a 2D quadrotor with 6 state variables and 2 control inputs (motor thrusts):

**States**
- `x`, `y`: Position
- `Œ∏`: Pitch angle
- `·∫ã`, `·∫è`, `Œ∏Ãá`: Velocities

**Inputs**
- `u‚ÇÅ`, `u‚ÇÇ`: Left and right motor thrusts

**Dynamics**
\[
\begin{cases}
\ddot{x} = \frac{1}{m}(u_1 + u_2)\sin(\theta) \\
\ddot{y} = \frac{1}{m}(u_1 + u_2)\cos(\theta) - g \\
\ddot{\theta} = \frac{L}{I}(u_1 - u_2)
\end{cases}
\]

## Controllers

### üìè Linear MPC

- Linearized around hover: `Œ∏ = 0`, `·∫ã = ·∫è = 0`
- Solved using **YALMIP + quadprog**
- Cost function:
  \[
  J = \sum_{k=0}^{H_p} e_k^T Q e_k + u_k^T R u_k
  \]
- Constraints on thrust, position, velocity, and pitch

### üå™ Nonlinear MPC

- Adds wind disturbance as drag force:
  \[
  f_{\text{ext}} = \beta v |v|
  \]
- Full nonlinear model solved using **CasADi + IPOPT**
- Cost includes tracking, energy, smoothness, and pitch penalties

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

- **LMPC**: Discretized linear model, optimized using `quadprog`
- **NLMPC**: Nonlinear discrete model using Euler integration, optimized with `IPOPT`
- Simulations run in MATLAB with reference sinusoidal trajectories

---

##  Results

| Controller | MSE (x) | MSE (y) |
|------------|--------:|--------:|
| **LMPC**   | 0.5255  | 0.4211  |
| **NLMPC**  | 2.5661  | 0.2624  |

- LMPC performs well without disturbances
- NLMPC compensates for wind but shows higher MSE in `x` due to nonlinear effects
- Thrust and pitch vary among drones to handle tracking and disturbance rejection

## Conclusion

- **LMPC**: Simple, fast, effective for ideal conditions, but can't handle disturbances
- **NLMPC**: More robust and practical for real systems with disturbances and nonlinearities
- **MPC** excels when:
  - Predictive control is beneficial
  - Constraints need to be explicitly managed
  - System dynamics are known and structured
